├── data  
│   ├── Seattle_City_Limits_3136622578314448116.gpkg - Seattle City Limits downloaded from the City of Seattle. Only used in the qGIS map.  
│   ├── Street_Network_Database_SND_5117857036965774451.gpkg - Stree Network downloaded from the City of Seattle. This is the starting file.  
│   ├── Street_Network_Database_Seattle_Central_Streets.csv - A list of Street IDs curated using qGIS. Included for use in Step 02.  
│   ├── blank_street_type_modified.xlsx - Roads with a manually created classifications. Used to ensure that every road has a classification (AVE, WAY, PL, for example.)  
│   └── streets_to_remove.txt - a list (12, as of 2024/1/10) of short segments from the original data that can be removed. These are most likely erronneous data artifacts inadvertently left in during data processing by the City of Seattle. These were discovered by panning around a qGIS map visually identifying oddities. I have no doubt there are more to discover. In step 2, this file can be loaded and used to remove the erroneous segments.

└── seattles_discontinuous_streets_2024_11_20.pptx - Presentation I gave to the [CUGOS](https://cugos.org/) group on November 20, 2024 showcasing the motivation, findings, limitations and next steps of this project. This presentation encompasses a lot of the work as described in this `README.md` file.
