├── data -   
│   ├── Seattle_City_Limits_3136622578314448116.gpkg - Seattle City Limits downloaded from the City of Seattle. Only used in the qGIS map.    
│   ├── Street_Network_Database_SND_5117857036965774451.gpkg - Stree Network downloaded from the City of Seattle. This is the starting file.    
│   ├── blank_street_type_working.xlsx - Roads with a manually created classifications. Used to ensure that every road has a classification (AVE, WAY, PL, for example.)    
│   ├── city_sector.csv - list of SND and corresponding city sector   
│   ├── city_sector_check_working.xlsx - list of combined city sectors and a manually updated sort order of the combination  
│   ├── state_name.csv - list of state names, used in a trivial analysis in Step 7  
│   ├── street_groups_working.xlsx - list of streets and manually curated street groups  
│   ├── streets_to_remove.txt - a list (1, as of 2025/2/23) of short segments from the original data that can be removed. These are most likely erronneous data artifacts inadvertently left in during data processing by the City of Seattle. These were discovered by panning around a qGIS map visually identifying oddities. I have no doubt there are more to discover. In step 2, this file can be loaded and used to remove the erroneous segments.  Setting the segment_type = 1 removes a lot of stubby streets as well.
