# Introduction
How often do roads in the City of Seattle, start, stop, and resume? In Seattle, this typically looks like a road running for a few blocks, terminating, and then resuming a few blocks later. A prime example is Galer Street. Galer street is an east-west street that runs through the neighborhoods of Magnolia, Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, and Madison Park. This street is not continuous. Rather, it is separated into several portions. There are five streets that feature the name "Galer". 

The table below summarizes the number of discontinuties in each portion.

| Street Name | Portions|
|---|----|
|E Galer St | 5
|Galer PL N | 1
|Galer ST | 2
|W Galer ST | 5 |
|W Galer ST Flyover | 1 |

The streets with the name Galer differ based on street prefix and street type. E Galer Street is found in the Eastern Portion of the city and W Galer is found in the wester portion of the city. The suffix St indicates the road is of type "street" - a navigatable road - while the suffix PL indicates the road is of type Place, a road with a dead end that is accessible only through the main street.
